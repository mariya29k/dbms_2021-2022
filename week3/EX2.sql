-- education level of 16. He also wants to know how many employees have this
-- education level.
SELECT MIN(SALARY) AS MIN, MAX(SALARY) AS MAX, AVG(SALARY) AS AVG, COUNT(*) AS COUNT

-- Problem 3
-- Joe's manager is interested in some additional salary information. This time, he
-- wants information for every department that appears in the EMPLOYEE table,
-- provided that the department has more than five employees. The report needs to
-- show the department number, the minimum, maximum, and average yearly salary,
-- and the number of employees who work in the department.
SELECT WORKDEPT, MIN(SALARY) AS MIN, MAX(SALARY) AS MAX, AVG(SALARY) AS AVG, COUNT(*) AS COUNT
